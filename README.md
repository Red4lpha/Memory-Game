# Smash Bros Memory Game

React project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card) curriculum.

Simple memory game based off characters from the Smash Brothers video game series. An array of 12 characters is randomly arranged and placed in a grid for the user. After a character card is clicked, a boolean flag is set, user score is incremented by 1, and the characters array is re-randomized again. Once the same character is clicked twice, game is over and if applicable the hi-score is changed. 

Learned about UseState and UseEffect usage for this project.
